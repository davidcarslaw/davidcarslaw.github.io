abstract = "Many European countries do not meet legal air quality standards for ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) near roads; a problem that has been forecasted to persist to 2030. Although European air quality standards regulate NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, emissions stan- dards for new vehicles instead set limits for NO<sub>x</sub>—the combination of nitric oxide (NO) and NO<sub>2</sub>. From around 1990 onwards, the total emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> declined significantly in Europe, but roadside concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>—a regulated species—declined much less than expected. This discrepancy has been attributed largely to the increasing usage of diesel vehicles in Europe and more directly emitted tailpipe NO<sub>2</sub>. Here we apply a data-filtering technique to 130 million hourly measurements of NO<sub>x</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) from roadside monitoring stations across 61 urban areas in Europe over the period 1990–2015 to estimate the continent-wide trends of directly emitted NO<sub>2</sub>. We find that the ratio of NO<sub>2</sub> to NO<sub>x</sub> emissions increased from 1995 to around 2010 but has since stabilized at a level that is substantially lower than is assumed in some key emissions inventories. The proportion of NO<sub>x</sub> now being emitted directly from road transport as NO<sub>2</sub> is up to a factor of two smaller than the estimates used in policy projections. We therefore conclude that there may be a faster attainment of roadside NO<sub>2</sub> air quality standards across Europe than is currently expected."
