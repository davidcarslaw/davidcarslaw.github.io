My principal research focus is urban air pollution and specifically the development of improved data analysis techniques and the measurement of vehicle emission. 

Our vehicle emission measurement research is focused on the use of open-path remote sensing.We have carried out many vehicle emission campaigns in the UK using two types of instrument: the University of Denver [FEAT](http://www.feat.biochem.du.edu/) system and the Opus RSD5000 system. A short summary of this work is shown below.
